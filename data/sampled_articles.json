Research into classification of High\nDimension Low Sample Size (HDLSS) data, in particular microarray data, has made\nconsiderable advances, but regression prediction for high-dimensional data with\ncontinuous responses has had less attention. Recently Bair et al (2006)\nproposed an efficient prediction method based on supervised principal component\nregression (PCR). Motivated by the fact that a larger number of principal\ncomponents results in better regression performance, this paper extends the\nmethod of Bair et al in several ways: a comprehensive variable ranking is\ncombined with a selection of the best number of components for PCR, and the new\nmethod further extends to regression with multivariate responses. The new\nmethod is particularly suited to HDLSS problems. Applications to simulated and\nreal data demonstrate the performance of the new method. Comparisons with Bair\net al (2006) show that for high-dimensional data in particular the new ranking\nresults in a smaller number of predictors and smaller errors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Jul 2008 07:11:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-07-28","authors_parsed":[["Koch","Inge",""],["Naito","Kanta",""]]}

The\ninformation is measured by non-probabilistic uncertainty of uncertain\nvariables, the non-stochastic counterparts of random variables. For $X$ that is\nrelated to released data $Y$, the non-stochastic brute-force leakage is\nmeasured by the complexity of exhaustively checking all the possibilities of\nthe private attribute $U$ of $X$ by an adversary. The complexity refers to the\nnumber of trials to successfully guess $U$. Maximizing this leakage over all\npossible private attributes $U$ gives rise to the maximal (i.e., worst-case)\nnon-stochastic brute-force guessing leakage. This is proved to be fully\ndetermined by the minimal non-stochastic uncertainty of $X$ given $Y$, which\nalso determines the worst-case attribute $U$ indicating the highest privacy\nrisk if $Y$ is disclosed. The maximal non-stochastic brute-force guessing\nleakage is shown to be proportional to the non-stochastic identifiability of\n$X$ given $Y$ and upper bounds the existing maximin information. The latter\nquantifies the information leakage when an adversary must perfectly guess $U$\nin one-shot via $Y$.

The on-die ECC function and its effects on\nDRAM reliability are considered trade secrets, so only the manufacturer knows\nprecisely how on-die ECC alters the externally-visible reliability\ncharacteristics. Consequently, on-die ECC obstructs third-party DRAM customers\n(e.g., test engineers, experimental researchers), who typically design, test,\nand validate systems based on these characteristics.\n  To give third parties insight into precisely how on-die ECC transforms DRAM\nerror patterns during error correction, we introduce Bit-Exact ECC Recovery\n(BEER), a new methodology for determining the full DRAM on-die ECC function\n(i.e., its parity-check matrix) without hardware tools, prerequisite knowledge\nabout the DRAM chip or on-die ECC mechanism, or access to ECC metadata (e.g.,\nerror syndromes, parity information). BEER exploits the key insight that\nnon-intrusively inducing data-retention errors with carefully-crafted test\npatterns reveals behavior that is unique to a specific ECC function.\n  We use BEER to identify the ECC functions of 80 real LPDDR4 DRAM chips with\non-die ECC from three major DRAM manufacturers. We evaluate BEER's correctness\nin simulation and performance on a real system to show that BEER is effective\nand practical across a wide range of on-die ECC functions. To demonstrate\nBEER's value, we propose and discuss several ways that third parties can use\nBEER to improve their design and testing practices.

The algebraic inverses of the mass matrices map DoFs\nattached to the barycentric dual grid back to DoFs attached to the\ncorresponding primal tetrahedral grid, but they are of limited practical use\nsince they are dense.\n  In this paper we present a new geometric construction of sparse inverse mass\nmatrices for arbitrary tetrahedral grids and possibly anisotropic materials,\ndebunking the conventional wisdom that the barycentric dual grid prohibits a\nsparse representation for inverse mass matrices. In particular, we provide a\nunified framework for the construction of both edge and face mass matrices and\ntheir sparse inverses. Such a unifying principle relies on novel geometric\nreconstruction formulas, from which, according to a well established design\nstrategy, local mass matrices are constructed as the sum of a consistent and a\nstabilization term.

It has been argued, however, that such a\ntrack-based mass (M_trk) may tend to be overestimated for the case of red\ngiants. Meanwhile, there is an alternative approach of evaluating mass (M_gLT)\ndirectly from surface gravity (g), L, and T_eff. The practical reliability of\nM_gLT was examined for ~100 benchmark giants in the Kepler field, for which\natmospheric parameters are already determined and the reliable mass (M_seis)\nalong with the evolutionary status are known from asteroseismology. In\naddition, similar check was also made for the accuracy of M_trk for comparison.\nIt turned out that, while a reasonable correlation is seen between M_gLT and\nM_seis almost irrespective of the stellar property, its precision is rather\ninsufficient because log(M_gLT\/M_seis) distributes rather widely within\n~+\/-0.2--0.3dex. In contrast, the reliability of M_trk was found to depend on\nthe evolutionary status.

Examples of such semirings include Viterbi semiring, min-max or\naccess control semiring, tropical semiring, and fuzzy semiring.\n  The present work investigates the complexity of constraint optimization\nproblems over semirings. The generic optimization problem we study is the\nfollowing: Given a propositional formula $\\varphi$ over $n$ variable and a\nsemiring $(K,+,\\cdot,0,1)$, find the maximum value over all possible\ninterpretations of $\\varphi$ over $K$. This can be seen as a generalization of\nthe well-known satisfiability problem. A related problem is to find an\ninterpretation that achieves the maximum value. In this work, we first focus on\nthese optimization problems over the Viterbi semiring, which we call optConfVal\nand optConf.\n  We show that for general propositional formulas in negation normal form,\noptConfVal and optConf are in ${\\mathrm{FP}}^{\\mathrm{NP}}$. We investigate\noptConf when the input formula $\\varphi$ is represented as a CNF. For CNF\nformulae, we first derive an upper bound on optConfVal as a function of the\nnumber of maximum satisfiable clauses. In particular, we show that if $r$ is\nthe maximum number of satisfiable clauses in a CNF formula with $m$ clauses,\nthen its optConfVal is at most $1\/4^{m-r}$. Building on this we establish that\noptConfVal for CNF formulae is hard for the complexity class\n${\\mathrm{FP}}^{\\mathrm{NP}[\\log]}$. We also design polynomial-time\napproximation algorithms and establish an inapproximability for optConfVal.

Due various\nreasons, e.g. calibration inaccuracies, usage of different sensors, input\nimages for pansharpening: low resolution multispectral image or more precisely\nthe calculated intensity image and high resolution panchromatic image may\ndiffer in values of their physical properties, e.g. radiances or reflectances\ndepending on the processing level.

Recently, unlabeled molecular data has become abundant, which\nfacilitates the rapid development of self-supervised learning for GNNs in the\nchemical domain.

Borrowing techniques from recent work on principal\nsubgraph mining, we obtain a compact vocabulary of prevalent fragments from a\nlarge pretraining dataset. From the extracted vocabulary, we introduce several\nfragment-based contrastive and predictive pretraining tasks. The contrastive\nlearning task jointly pretrains two different GNNs: one on molecular graphs and\nthe other on fragment graphs, which represents higher-order connectivity within\nmolecules. By enforcing consistency between the fragment embedding and the\naggregated embedding of the corresponding atoms from the molecular graphs, we\nensure that the embeddings capture structural information at multiple\nresolutions. The structural information of fragment graphs is further exploited\nto extract auxiliary labels for graph-level predictive pretraining.

Typical DNP methods require use of cryogens, large magnetic\nfields, and high power microwaves, which are expensive and unwieldy.\nNanodiamond particles, rich in Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) centers, have attracted\nattention as alternative DNP agents because they can potentially be optically\nhyperpolarized at room temperature.

However, up to now the details of this process are not well\nunderstood. In this work, a novel experimental approach that combines\nLow-Energy Electron Microscopy (LEEM), Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy\n(EELS), and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) is used to study changes induced by\nelectrons in the 0-40 eV range in thin films of molecular organometallic EUV\nresists known as tin-oxo cages. LEEM-EELS spectroscopic experiments were used\nto detect surface charging upon electron exposure and to estimate the electron\nlanding energy.

The same chemical processes that yield densification render the\nsolubility change responsible for the pattern formation in the lithographic\napplication. Remarkably, electrons as low as 1.2 eV are able to induce chemical\nreactions in the Sn-based resist.
